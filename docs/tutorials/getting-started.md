# Let's go!

If you haven't yet, start by installing Tiled.  Then continue by installing `pixeldeck.`

## install tiled

You can download tiled from their [website](https://www.mapeditor.org/)

__Note:__ This project is only aiming to support 2d orthographic tilesets right now.

## install pixeldeck

You may chose to install it to a project folder

    $ npm install --save github://badquanta/pixeldeck

Or you may chose to install it system wide:

    $ npm install -g github://badquanta/pixeldeck

Or even skip installing it, and just run a command via npx:

    $ npx https://github.com/badquanta/pixeldeck~pixeldeck serve
